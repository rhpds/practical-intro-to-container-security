[CAUTION]
.Lab Tips
===
* Do not `rm` any files or directories you did not create as the servers can not be rebuilt.
* Make a backup copy before modifying any file.

== BookBag Environment

BookBag provides a integrated student client environment in a web browser. It includes the lab guide, terminals and a collection of client programs (i.e. `ssh`) to access the servers used in the lab. In case you are interested, BookBag runs as a container and can be hosted by `podman` or https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift]. See `deploy-lab-guide.sh` and `deploy-openshift.md` for details.

[TIP]
.BookBag Tips
--
- Increase the width of the web browser to view the table of contents.
- Move the horizontal and vertical dividers as needed.
- Use the menu in the upper right to open additional terminals.
- Commands may be copy and pasted from the lab guide to the terminals.

.Bastion
****
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
-----
$ *{STUDENT_SSH_COMMAND}*

.Nodes
****
To login to the either node from the bastion, `ssh` must be run using `sudo`.

== BookBag Instance: Optional Configuration

This configuration is optional but helpful. Be certain this is
performed in the BookBag shell only.

.Create a SSH key pair using the default key file with no passphrase
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
*ssh-keygen -P "" -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa*
----
--

.Prevent the SSH session from timing out
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
*echo -e "Host * \nServerAliveInterval 120" >> $HOME/.ssh/config*
----
--

.Copy the SSH identity to the bastion
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
*ssh-copy-id -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" lab-user@{STUDENT_BASTION_HOSTNAME}*
----
--

.Log in to bastion with SSH password
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
*{STUDENT_SSH_PASSWORD}*
----
[subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
lab-user@{STUDENT_BASTION_HOSTNAME}'s password: *`{STUDENT_SSH_PASSWORD}`*

Number of key(s) added:        1

.Try logging into the bastion without providing a password
--
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}", role=execute-1]
----
*{STUDENT_SSH_COMMAND}*
